# Elite: Dangerous notes

## Mining

 - Reddit Wiki [on mining](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteMiners/wiki/mininglocations/)

1. Pulse Wave Analyzer - orange is good - higher Class -> better range. Good for Surface, Subsurface, Core, but skip for Laser.
1. Prospector limpets - you buy the Controller - the limpets are disposable.
1. Collector limpets - for collecting asteroid chunks (and other things in other gameloops.)
   - There is also a Mining Controller available which lets you control both sets of limpets.
1. Abrasion Blasters - for surface deposits that you can target.
1. Mining Laser - for surface deposits that you can't target. Laser mining is more like old-school Elite.
