# Elite: Dangerous notes

## Mining

 - Reddit Wiki [on mining](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteMiners/wiki/mininglocations/)

### Mandatory
1. Refinery. Higher Class -> more bins. Fragments can include multiple resources but a bin can only refine one type of resource at a time and leave the rejected resources in the hopper. Since a bin can take a while to get to 100% you really need more than one bin to deal with mixed fragments effectively.

2. At least one of
   - Abrasion Blasters - for surface deposits that you can target.
   - Mining Laser - for surface deposits that you can't target. Laser mining is more like old-school Elite.

### Extremely helpful but not actually mandatory

1. Pulse Wave Analyzer - orange is good - higher Class -> better range. Good for Surface, Subsurface, Core, but skip for Laser.
1. Prospector limpets - you buy the Controller - the limpets are disposable.
1. Collector limpets - for collecting asteroid chunks (and other things in other gameloops.)
   - There is also a Mining Controller available which lets you control both sets of limpets.
